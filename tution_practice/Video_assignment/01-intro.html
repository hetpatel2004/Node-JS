        <dt>1:-What is Node.js and where does it run?</dt>
        <dd>Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser. It runs on the server

        <hr>
        <dt>4:-How does Node.js handle multiple requests?</dt>
        <dd>Node.js uses a single thread and event loop to handle many requests asynchronously.</dd>
        <hr>
        <dt>5:-Why is Node.js non-blocking?</dt>
        <dd>Because it uses asynchronous operations, so it does not wait for tasks to finish.</dd>

        <hr>

        <dt>9. What happens when you run a JavaScript file in Node.js?</dt>
        <dd>Node loads the file, executes it using the V8 engine, and runs it in the Node runtime.</dd>
        <hr>

        <dt>10. What is process.env and how is it used?</dt>
        <dd>process.env stores environment variables used for configuration.</dd>

        <dd>window is for browsers, global is for Node.js.</dd>
        <hr>

        <dt>12. How does Node.js execute JavaScript outside the browser?</dt>
        <dd>Using the V8 engine and Node runtime APIs.</dd>
        <hr>

        <dt>13. Explain the Node.js runtime lifecycle.</dt>
        <dd>Start → execute code → event loop runs → process exits.</dd>
        <hr>

        <!-- LECTURE 03: Modules & require -->
        <dt>14. What are modules in Node.js?</dt>
